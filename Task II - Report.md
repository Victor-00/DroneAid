## Transistors 

- The transistor is our most important example of an “active” component, a device that can amplify, producing an output signal with more power in it than the input signal.
- In its simplest form, the bipolar transistor can be viewed as a voltage-dependent current source.

- The bipolar transistor consists of three doped regions forming a sandwich. 
- The three terminals are called the “base,” the “emitter,” and the “collector.”
- The emitter “emits” charge carriers and the collector “collects” them while the base controls the number of carriers that make this journey. 
- We denote the terminal voltages by VE, VB, and VC , and the voltage differences by VBE, VCB, and VCE.
- When base-emitter junction is forward biased (V$_B$$_E$  >  0) and the base-collector junction is reverse biased ( V$_B$$_C$  <  0) , the device is biased in the "forward active region" or is in "active mode."
